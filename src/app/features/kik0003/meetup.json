Companies are increasingly outsourcing product development and services to reduce costs and focus on their core business. As writers, we’re familiar with companies contracting out technical communication work. However, my presentation will discuss outsourcing product development and manufacturing and what impact this can have on in-house technical communication. What challenges can technical writers face when working with content developed by another company? I’ll look at such topics as content quality, legal issues, localization, tools, terminology management, and working with teams that are dispersed globally and across different companies and cultures with a focus on working with Chinese suppliers.</p> <p>Presenter:<br/>Jennifer O'Neill is a Senior Technical Writer at UTC Fire &amp; Security in Diegem, Belgium.</p> ",

Kris is a passionate Software engineer who met equally passionate people and founded Triple D to Design, Develop, Deploy software together. When he isn’t spending time with the family you can probably find him coding.</p> <p>Setting up your applications to automatically and continuously deploy might have caused you headaches in the past. But these days it’s becoming a lot easier to get a deployment pipeline up and running. Using the recently released rancher 2 we’Il create a fresh kubernetes cluster. Then a spring boot application will be generated by start.spring.io that will be pushed to gitlab. Gitlab will add some magic autodevops dust to the project. After the dust settles there will be a running application, with dynamic review environments, and detailed metrics.</p> <p>This session will be a combination of a presentation explaining how this works and a live demo setting everything up from scratch. Yes, you read it correctly. Kubernetes cluster, an application and CD allowing an environment per branch all setup during this session.</p> <p>A sharing session will take place afterward with pizzas and a few beers to discuss and share :-)</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p>The Wemanity Team</p> ",

It is not only important to have a diverse team of tech talents, it is also important to take your users into account when you build it.</p> <p>If you're nodding your head, this workshop is for you. Keep reading.</p> <p>The Bacchao Project, Open Knowledge Belgium and BeCentral are happy to bring you a hands-on &amp; insightful workshop called \"Building Tech for Diversity and Inclusion\".</p> <p>Tickets: <a href=\"https://workshop-building-tech-for-diversity-inclusion.eventbrite.co.uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://workshop-building-tech-for-diversity-inclusion.eventbrite.co.uk</a>. Meetup RSVP is not enough to secure your spot, please don't forget to get your tickets.</p> <p>The workshop will take the participants around the fundamentals of designing technology that takes the diversity of its intended uses into account and includes these users with active participation. It's designed for developers &amp; funders who want to rethink their technology.</p> <p>During the full day hands-on workshop, you will look into \"Manual for building technology for diversity and inclusion\" written by The Bachchao Project. The manual is published under open license and is available on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/thebachchaoproject/Manual-to-build-tech-for-diversity-and-Inclusion/blob/master/BuildingTechforDiversityandInclusion101.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/thebachchaoproject/Manual-to-build-tech-for-diversity-and-Inclusion/blob/master/BuildingTechforDiversityandInclusion101.pdf</a>.</p> <p>Firstly, you will deep dive into everyday apps and technologies that could be built by the participants or used widely and document how to improve them. Secondly, you will take these learnings into consideration to reflect on your own project.</p> <p>About the speaker</p> <p>Chinmayi is a computer science engineer by qualification and the founder of The Bachchao Project, a community that works on the intersection of gender and technology. She previously worked as an engineer with Nokia and founded Saakshin, a software services start-up in Bengaluru, India.</p> <p>Over the past four years, Chinmayi has been a pivotal part of several civil society projects, which involve building technology communities as well as creating technological solutions to address gender and humanitarian issues. She supports the technical and policy needs of numerous groups and organisations such as Internews, Safecity, Breakthrough, Flone, Geeks Without Bounds, and Bailancho Saad.</p> <p>We want our workshop to be an event anyone can join. Price shouldn't be a barrier. Let us know why you really want to participate and apply for a \"Hacker Ticket\" to get your ticket at a discounted price (15€).

      "description": "<p>Introduction to audio-electronics</p> <p>This four-piece seminar-series is meant to teach some of the underlying principles of audio-amplification, frequency-filtering and signal-processing that apply to amplifiers, guitar stompboxes and microphone preamps. During this course you will be introduced to the fundamental building blocks of analog circuits (resistors, capacitors, transistors and op-amps), learn how to distinguish circuit-building blocks and how to apply some simple calculators for frequency-filtering. Lastly, we'll dissect some schematics to understand the function of each and every component.<br/>The workshop will conclude with a 'practical' involving the building of your own DIY distortion- or fuzz pedal, for which kits will be supplied. The supply of these is limited, so make sure you sign up timely.</p> <p>-Basic knowledge of electronics is useful, but I'll try to accommodate all attendees<br/>-Some mathematics might be introduced, but they'll be approached from a pragmatists' perspective</p> <p>Part 1. (Wednesday 19:00 - 21:00 --- 13/06/2018---)<br/>We all know what sound is, but what does it look like in its electronic form? We'll see how a speaker works and how it is able to produce sound. Then we’ll look at various waveforms (sines, square waves and other sinusoids) and the translation between the ‘frequency-domain’ and ‘time-domain’. When the crowd is math-savvy we could try a Taylor-expansion of a square wave. Otherwise we’ll indulge in the knowledge that Fourier-transformations give us.<br/>With our knowledge of waveforms, we will assess various types of signal distortion. Some more pleasant than others.</p> <p>Part 2. (Wednesday 19:00 - 21:00 --- 20/06/2018---)<br/>Time to get into some real electronics here. We’ll be introduced to the basic drawing elements and shapes of circuits and take a look at the principal components of analog circuits: Resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors. With the latter, some basic equations will (have to) be introduced / recapitulated.<br/>With our knowledge of peripheral components, we’ll introduce the Operational Amplifier and review the usage of these so-called OPAMPS in audio circuits.</p> <p>Part 3. (Wednesday 19:00 - 21:00 --- 27/06/2018---)<br/>This course we’ll look at the filters we could think up with the knowledge of our last course. Resistor-capacitor networks will be discussed, and basic calculations for cutoff-frequencies will be demonstrated. Secondly, fundamental building blocks of audio circuits are on the program: Buffer stages, gain stages, clipping stages, frequency filters and power supplies .<br/>Part 4. (Wednesday 19:00 - 21:00 --- 4/07/2018---)<br/>Our last theoretical escapade will be the analysis of real-life circuits. With the knowledge of previous lectures, we should be able to dissect a variety of well-known and interesting real life circuits. A selection of circuits will be up for discussion, depending on the preferences of the attendees. If time permits, we’ll draw out the good ‘ole oscilloscope and tinker with some breadboarded circuits to see- and hear the consequences of our modifications.</p> <p>Praxis in practice (Saturday 12:00 onwards --- 7/07/2018---)<br/>If there is any participants left after this fourfold technical torture, allow me to remind you that nothing tastes (or sounds) quite as good as the fruits of your own labour. Three types of kits will be available for this session: A distortion pedal , a fuzz pedal and a third yet-to-be developed secret kit. They’ll consist of a Pre-drilled enclosure, a PCB, all peripheral components and a solid explanation of how-to-put-the-thing-together. This will def be an afternoon session, and I’ll be there to assist everyone in their soldering-and-assembly process. To pay for the enclosure, pots and the PCB-manufacturing, a fee of € 35,- will be charged. The three circuits available are HSBXL-only and loosely based on the sickest sounds the streets have to offer. All hail King Buzzo, Dimebag Amen.</p> ",

Resistor-capacitor networks will be discussed, and basic calculations for cutoff-frequencies will be demonstrated. Secondly, fundamental building blocks of audio circuits are on the program: Buffer stages, gain stages, clipping stages, frequency filters and power supplies .<br/>Part 4. (Wednesday 19:00 - 21:00 --- 4/07/2018---)<br/>Our last theoretical escapade will be the analysis of real-life circuits. With the knowledge of previous lectures, we should be able to dissect a variety of well-known and interesting real life circuits. A selection of circuits will be up for discussion, depending on the preferences of the attendees. If time permits, we’ll draw out the good ‘ole oscilloscope and tinker with some breadboarded circuits to see- and hear the consequences of our modifications.</p> <p>Praxis in practice (Saturday 12:00 onwards --- 7/07/2018---)<br/>If there is any participants left after this fourfold technical torture, allow me to remind you that nothing tastes (or sounds) quite as good as the fruits of your own labour. Three types of kits will be available for this session: A distortion pedal , a fuzz pedal and a third yet-to-be developed secret kit. They’ll consist of a Pre-drilled enclosure, a PCB, all peripheral components and a solid explanation of how-to-put-the-thing-together. This will def be an afternoon session, and I’ll be there to assist everyone in their soldering-and-assembly process. To pay for the enclosure, pots and the PCB-manufacturing, a fee of € 35,- will be charged. The three circuits available are HSBXL-only and loosely based on the sickest sounds the streets have to offer. All hail King Buzzo, Dimebag Amen.</p> ",

Their labels have a QR code which takes you to videos, pictures and explanations on the origins and the stories of what you’re wearing.</p> <p>Made &amp; More is a belgian sustainable fashion brand created by Stéphanie Fellen, whom we are very pleased to welcome for our new Le Wagon talk. She launched her own business online and went through the struggles many entrepreneurs face, including filing for bankruptcy. But hard work paid off, and her vision became reality. Her clothes are made with total transparency regarding who made the garments, and with respect for the people and the environnement. The brand is in line with circular economy vision.</p> <p>She will take us through her entrepreneurial journey, discuss crowdfunding and the use of technology to improve the traceability of fashion.</p> <p>6:15PM &gt; Doors opening<br/>6:30PM &gt; Start of Le Wagon Talk, be there on time! :-)</p> <p>It’s free, but registration is mandatory : <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yoS2uT\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2yoS2uT</a></p> ",

Get things done and meet like-minded people in a session of working together.</p> <p>When and Where?</p> <p>Bring either a laptop, iPad, notebook or whatever you need to complete your tasks. If you arrive first, please write a comment below about where you're sitting and how to identify you (e.g. shirt color). If you don't see a comment, you are the first person, so post one.</p> <p>What?</p> <p>25 minutes work sessions (\"Pomodoro Technique\") with 5 minutes of break between each. We'll have 4 sessions in total, which sums up to 2 hours. Optional to continue after that until the last person gives up!</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>Working together is proved to boost your productivity. It will also create the accountability as you will declare your goals and results for each session. Also, meeting new people face to face while working together will connect you to potential team members, clients and friends. It's a powerful mix of focused work with networking in short breaks.</p> <p>How?</p> <p>Just before we start, each participant will shortly introduce herself/himself, and declare their tasks for the next work session. We recommend each participant to share your objective for each 25-minute session in the comments here for best results. We also allow people who couldn't make it and stayed at home to post their next task in the comment.</p> <p>A volunteer will start a 25-minute timer, followed by 5-minute break timer (we recommend using this online timer: <a href=\"https://www.marinaratimer.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.marinaratimer.com/</a><br/>Remember to share the specific link to your timer in the group comments just before the first session, so everyone knows how much time is left, including the people who work at home.</p> <p>At the end of a session (25 minutes), each participant will share with the group if their task was completed, and their next session task (also in comments), and we'll start again once the 5 minutes break ends.</p> <p>What's next?</p> <p>Join us at the next Work Jam, they are free for now. Also, if you enjoyed the productivity boost from working together and meeting new people consider joining a coworking space! Find it at our favourite and the world’s biggest coworking directory: <a href=\"https://www.coworker.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.coworker.com/</a></p> ",

      "description": "<p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>This meetup is dedicated to all people who create digital products and services.</p> <p>Each month our speakers, industry experts, are sharing their knowledge and experience. Explore the world of design with us, get inspired and meet interesting people.</p> <p>This month we have the following guests speakers:</p> <p>1) DAMIEN VOSSEN</p> <p>\"Voice Experience - Year Zero\"</p> <p>After a few decades, we are finally at the point where voice technology is reliable enough to produce enjoyable experiences. More than ever, we need to think about how users will interact with those interfaces that can be amazingly powerful and frustrating at the same time. Damien will share with you what are the main usage today, how does it work from a technical point of view, explain you what are the specifications of voice experiences and what are the main challenges we still need to solve.</p> <p>- Passionate about story telling and digital products, Damien has worked for the last 5 years as a product manager and UX strategist for startups, major media companies and banks. He likes to ease and accelerate digital innovative projects in a human-centric way: technology must adapt to humans, not the other way around. He worked on mobile apps, chatbots and voice applications, but what he likes the most is to learn new stuff and share my knowledge about UX.</p> <p>2) JORN CRAEGHS</p> <p>\"Success of Silicon Valley Apps? Using Behavioural Psychology\"</p> <p>Why are we so addicted to our phones? How come Silicon Valley has got us hooked on apps? And what is their formula for success?<br/>In his talk, Jorn will share the leading theories that Silicon Valley teams use to attract users and design behaviour.</p> <p>- Jorn Craeghs is a Behavioural Designer. He uses his knowledge of behavioral psychology to understand human choices. And he comes up with interventions for behaviour change.<br/>He has mastered the trade at SUE Amsterdam where he started out as a Behavioural Strategist and ended up as the Insights Lead. After that he designed and directed the Behavioural Design Academy. In 2017 Jorn became an entrepreneur, working under the name Sade Studio. He now turns his knowledge of behavioural psychology into ideas that have a positive impact on our lives.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>18:00 - Opening doors, snacks &amp; drinks.<br/>18:30 - 2 talks of (+/-) 30 min<br/>19:30 - Networking, snacks &amp; drinks.</p> <p>NOTE: We are starting talks at 18:30, with the doors opening at 18:00, so please arrive on time to ensure we run to schedule.</p> <p>-</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you!<br/>Caroline, Mayti, &amp; Karol.</p> <p>-</p> <p>PS. Would you like to hear a specific talk? Are you interested in some topics? Would you like to share a speech with others, or you know someone who could - let us know! We will be happy to provide what interests you the most.</p> ",

We will also cover the principle of sound focus, what it is, how and when to use it. We'll see what we can do with MIDI as well. And finally, we'll go deeper in the rabbit hole and get introduced to the lower levels of sounds processing with the help of OpenSL ES and the SuperPowered library.</p> <p>Let's bring the noise.</p> <p>Entry level : Beginner</p> <p>// Bonus // Yannick will also share his experience with drones and on the integration of the SDK parrot in a mobile app + Demo of a proof of concept</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>18:00 - Opening doors, snacks &amp; drinks.<br/>18:30 - Let's talk Drones<br/>19:00 - The Sounds of Android<br/>19:45 - Networking, snacks &amp; drinks.</p> <p>NOTE: We are starting the talks at 18:30, with the doors opening at 18:00, so please arrive on time to ensure we run on schedule.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you!<br/>Yannick, Mayti &amp; Cédric</p> ",

Unless it rains badly as we're about to play, the game is on.</p> <p>Players of any age, weight, sex and size are allowed. Come as you are, at any time after 4pm.</p> <p>IMPORTANT REMINDER -- As Shitty Players, we don't bite or growl when someone misses the ball. We don't do penalties or yellow cards because we're so gentle we don't need them. We vaguely know of the existence of other rules like off-side but we'd rather ignore them than argue about them. We may or may not keep track of the score: this is a game where everyone wins.</p> <p>To help build the Team, come with 2 t-shirts white and black (or similar colors: light grey and dark blue etc).

Our first group, The Smoothies, is raising funds (1500€) for Oxfam on that occasion. If you feel you want to support our challenge, we’ll be very grateful for any contribution. Our webpage is here: www.oxfamtrailwalker.be/en/editions/oxfam-trailwalker-2018/the-smoothies</p> <p>Btw, for a tax receipt, see here: www.oxfamtrailwalker.be/en/the-challenge/revenue-of-oxfam-trailwalker/tax-receipt-for-belgium<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>As promised, we’re increasing our distances during the coming weeks. We go for +50km this weekend. Always with some possibilities to leave or join the hike.</p> <p>Here the distances and the estimated timing, including breaks. You decide, whenever you want, where you prefer to stop:</p> <p>- Chastre – Couture-Saint-Germain: 24km (TEC bus 36 to Braine-l’Alleud + train to Brussels) / estimated arrival at 16:30<br/>- Chastre – La Hulpe: 33km (TEC bus 366 to Brussels) / estimated arrival at 19:00<br/>- Chastre – Flagey: 51km / estimated arrival at 23:00</p> <p>●● Description:<br/>We meet at 09:10 in front of the Starbucks in Brussels Central.<br/>The train (ICT6960 direction Wavre) to Ottignies leaves from platform 3 at 09:22. It arrives at 09:58 in Ottignies, where we change for the train (L6260 direction Namur) to Chastre, leaving from platform 4 at 10:05. We reach our destination at 10:16 and start our hike.</p> <p>We’ll go directly west towards Villers-la-Ville and pass in front of its well-known abbey. We’ll then turn north towards Couture-Saint-Germain, Ohain and then La Hulpe.</p> <p>In Couture-Saint-Germain, after 24km, you’ll be able to go back to Brussels by public transport. There is a stop for the TEC bus 36 (Wavre – Braine-l’Alleud) to go to Braine-l’Alleud and from there the train to Brussels.<br/>The bus schedule is here:<br/>www.infotec.be/fr-be/medeplacer/horaires/ligne.aspx?ligne=B36&amp;titre=Braine-l'Alleud - Wavre</p> <p>Further on the way, after 33km, we’ll reach the La Hulpe castle. Arriving from a side entrance, we won’t pass trough the main Domain’s entrance. However, there you’ll easily find the stop “Etangs Solvay”, where you can catch the TEC bus 366 (Court-St-Etienne – Ixelles) to return directly to Brussels. Last services at 18:52 and 19:52 on Saturday.<br/>Of course, you may join us there also, if you prefer to do only the last 18km through the forest.<br/>www.infotec.be/fr-be/medeplacer/horaires/ligne.aspx?ligne=B366&amp;titre=366%20Court-St-Etienne%20-%20Rixensart%20-%20Ixelles/Elsene</p> <p>In front of the castle, we’ll have a good break, relaxing before our last shot. For that part, we’ll follow an itinerary running entirely trough the Sonian forest, up to the Bois de la Cambre. We’ll arrive late in Flagey, around 23:00. A tiring Saturday maybe. But, walking and discussing... that’s the kind of life we enjoy.</p> <p>Come and join!</p> <p>Note: if you plan to join us in La Hulpe, to do only the last leg, let me know it by sending me a message or leaving one on the comments section. Thanks.<br/>(...and thank you Karin for the pic)</p> <p>●● Details:<br/>Distance: ~ 51km<br/>Elevation gain: ~ 500m<br/>Net walking time: ~ 11h00<br/>Level: intermediate<br/>Weather forecast: 12°-15°C / sunny / no rain</p> <p>In the unlikely case of too bad weather, we may cancel a hike, even few hours before the event. If this must happen, we will of course update the Meetup website and send out an email to those registered. So, it is important to have access to either the Meetup.com website and/or your emails.</p> <p>●● What to bring:<br/>- raincoat / softshell<br/>- water + lunch for the break<br/>- Compeeds for blisters</p> <p>●● Basic rules:<br/>Please RSVP only if you really intend to come. And if your plans change, update your RSVP asap, even hours before the walk. This is basic courtesy towards others. Repeated late cancellations are not well considered (at all). No-shows even worse.</p> <p>Do not show up for a hike unless you are on the roster (i.e. Yes RSVP, but not Wait Listed).</p> ",

Want to learn how to play an instrument? Want to learn a new language? Or how to juggle balls? Whatever is the new skill, believe me: Agile can help you with it.</p> <p>In our life, we often face the need of learning something new. It can be to use in our jobs, to impress the person we love, to simply have fun or as a new hobby. Whatever is the reason, we know it can be challenging to acquire a new skill and it cannot be (yet) downloaded straight into our brain, like in some nice movies. We still need to read books, follow classes, research, practice and be patient. And the learning curve might be very slow.</p> <p>I’ll share with the audience a technique to learn anything new very fast!<br/>The reason why this method caught my attention: it’s incredibly similar to Agile values, principles, and practices! Thus, if you know what Agile is about, you are halfway to use it in your favor to learn anything you want, fast.</p> <p>Agenda<br/>18h - Welcome + networking<br/>18h30 - Presentation starts<br/>19h45 - End of presentation, let's talk over some pizzas and beers :)</p> <p>If you answer YES please make sure you come, or update your RSVP accordingly when you cannot make it!</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>The Wemanity Team (<a href=\"http://wemanity.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://wemanity.com</a>)</p> ",

      "description": "<p>Within the Capital Series and for those who are up for a slightly bigger commitment, I propose we read and then discuss the following book:</p> <p>Albert O. Hirschman (1977) The Passions and the Interests: Political Arguments for Capitalism Before Its Triumph (135 pages, foreword and notes not included)</p> <p>How the pursuit of material interests (so long seen as a vice) came to be seen as the way to contain the unruly and destructive passions of men. The repression of the passions in favour of the \"harmless\", if one-dimensional, interests in commercial life. I believe it invites further discussion about the intellectual underpinnings for capitalism alive in 2018 and our position in society - as consumers first and foremost? Also: what is (then and now presented as) the moral basis for capitalism?</p> <p>Mark Blyth on The Passions and the Interests (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrsh_bqoRBY&amp;t=132s\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrsh_bqoRBY&amp;t=132s</a>): [paraphrased] \"It gives you the evolution of capitalism in under 200 pages. It puts concisely what took Foucault several books written in tortured language; in order to have liberal capitalism, first liberal economic subjects need to be created. The creation of those subjects is a political project.\" You're welcome to rsvp in order to keep in the loop of the event. The date will be set later this Spring, preferably together. If you join the event, it is understood that you make an effort of acquainting yourself with the text in whatever capacity. I suggest reading the book, available here at 14,30 euro: <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Passions-and-the-Interests-Albert-O-Hirschman-Jeremy-Adelman-Amartya-Sen/9780691160252?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1519645229288&amp;sr=1-1\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Passions-and-the-Interests-Albert-O-Hirschman-Jeremy-Adelman-Amartya-Sen/9780691160252?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1519645229288&amp;sr=1-1</a>.</p> <p>Blurbs:</p> <p>In this volume, Albert Hirschman reconstructs the intellectual climate of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to illuminate the intricate ideological transformation that occurred, wherein the pursuit of material interests --so long condemned as the deadly sin of avarice --was assigned the role of containing the unruly and destructive passions of man. Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking. (...) To portray this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith.</p> <p>- Goodreads</p> <p>This is a history of the ideas laying the intellectual groundwork for capitalism. Hirschman describes how thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embraced the sin of avarice as an important counterweight to humankind's destructive passions. Capitalism was promoted by thinkers including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith as repressing the passions for \"harmless\" commercial activities. Hirschman noted that words including \"vice\" and \"passion\" gave way to \"such bland terms\" as \"advantage\" and \"interest.\"</p> <p>Hirschman described The Passions and the Interests as the book he most enjoyed writing. According to Hirschman biographer Jeremy Adelman, the book reflected Hirschman's political moderation, a challenge to reductive accounts of human nature by economists as a \"utility-maximizing machine\" as well as Marxian or communitarian \"nostalgia for a world that was lost to consumer avarice.\"<br/>- Adelman, Jeremy (April 7, 2013).

You can expect a day packed with innovative ideas, lots of networking opportunities and FUN. We will have 40 speakers, 6 master classes and 6 hands-on workshops, all in the efforts of demystifying Artificial Intelligence.</p> <p>The Keynote speaker: There is a budget for getting the best A.I. expert able at bringing the true face of A.I. to light to us to speak at this year’s Summit. So if you have someone in mind that impressed you recently, please send me his/her details.</p> <p>The location: In the previous 3 editions of the Summit, we constantly had trouble fitting all our eager participants into the available space. No more. This year, we reserved a much much bigger location for you all - 2,5 time larger to be exact - with one plenary seating room of 800 seats and 6 big training rooms on 2 floors at the ULB Solbosch Campus Auditorium K.</p> <p>Partner Village and Job Fair: There will be 2 vast areas for networking. One for the partners to show off their innovative ideas; the other for all to hire their best candidates.</p> <p>Invite your team: Make from #disummit your annual team event and have a productive day with your team at the University of Brussels.</p> <p>Recruit the best: You can promote your outstanding jobs, participate to the Job Fair and sponsor some tickets for students.<br/>Network and Nerd-Out: Opportunities to network and have fun will be plenty. We will use the conversation starter app again to facilitate your connexion with the most pertinent people. After the Summit, we have a beer garden set up for you to nerd-out after work with craft beer and a barbecue. Yes.</p> <p>Spread the word: As we have more capacity this year, we are implementing a special incentive program to reward your help in promoting the Summit. You are invited to bring your community at discounted rates and to earn free tickets.</p> <p>More information on disummit.com</p> <p>I’m looking forward to meeting you again! Don’t hesitate to contact me, should you have any questions.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>▼- Marche Active / Zen &amp; Workshop Végétarian -▼</p> <p>- Forêt de Soignes -</p> <p>\" Un déjeuner sain lors d'une activité physique; le goût et l’odorat..</p> <p>Développez, découvrez cette faculté, ce sens, et vous retrouverez la joie dans les doux parfums, vous aiderez ainsi le haut de votre corps à se ré-harmoniser, à se recentrer dans une sensation de bien-être.\"</p> <p>- ✧ Le végétarisme ✧-...</p> <p>Le végétarisme est une pratique alimentaire qui remonte à la Grèce Antique. De nombreux philosophes grecs étaient végétariens, dont Pythagore, que l’on considère comme le père du végétarisme. Dans un premier temps, on nommait \"pythagoriciens\" les personnes qui excluaient la viande de leur régime alimentaire. Plus tard, le végétarisme a conquis de nombreux autres penseurs et scientifiques célèbres comme Albert Einstein, Léonard de Vinci et Mahatma Gandhi.</p> <p>Il existe différentes catégories de végétarisme, de végétalisme et de véganisme , mais nous allons nous concentrer sur la définition globale de ce terme.</p> <p>Le végétarisme fait référence à un type d’alimentation qui exclut la viande (viande rouge et viande blanche), les poissons et les fruits de mer.</p> <p>-✧ Acti'march ou Marche Active ✧-</p> <p>Ce n’est pas une «promenade»...C'est une « discipline douce », qui développe l'endurance. C’est un entraînement (régulier) qui va permettre d’améliorer la condition physique en douceur, sans fatigue excessive. La marche active est une marche dynamique pratiquée de façon continue sur terrain plat. Elle a été élaborée par la fédération de gymnastique volontaire en collaboration avec des scientifiques et des médecins.</p> <p>- ✧ Le Bain de Forêt ✧-</p> <p>Un cocktail de bienfaits tout en profitant de la nature en se «déconnectant». Le Shinrin-Yoku, littéralement « bain de forêt », est né au Japon dans les années 80, les avantages pour la santé de cette activité consistant à passer du temps en forêt, sont reconnus dans d’autres cultures. Cependant, seul le Japon a fait de cette pratique une pierre angulaire de sa politique de médecine préventive. Une pratique qui repose sur une littérature scientifique de plus en plus abondante. C’est l’Agence des forêts japonaise qui a été la première a introduire le terme Shinrin-Yoku au début des années 80.</p> <p>L’idée était d’inciter les Japonais à se promener en forêt et à éveiller les sens du corps aux nombreuses interactions que le milieu forestier offre.</p> <p>Cette pratique est reconnue comme une véritable hygiène de vie et l’influence des environnements forestiers sur nos sens.</p> <p>▼- Les Objectifs :</p> <p>Les objectifs de la Marche Active &amp; Zen / Workshop Végétarian en forêt est de familiariser les participants à la cuisine végétarienne et végétalienne lors d'une marche active et douce, de découvrir leurs bénéfices sur la santé physique, mentale, le bien-être et ses multiples effets et bienfaits.</p> <p>- ✧ Les bienfaits et les effets de la nutrition végétarienne et végétalienne -</p> <p>\" Une seule journée passée sans manger de viande économise 5000 litres d’eau !</p> <p>La consommation d’eau des ménages n'est rien par rapport à ce que coûte l’agriculture et particulièrement les productions animales.\"</p> <p>- Bienfaits sur notre santé -</p> <p>- Les repas végétariens apportent une plus grande variété d’éléments nutritifs. Ils sont plus riches en fibres, en antioxydants, en vitamines et en minéraux. Ils sont une excellente source de protéines et de glucides complexes, donc d’énergie. Les lipides (gras) renferment moins de gras saturés et de cholestérol.</p> <p>- Pour vivre plus longtemps et en meilleure santé : une alimentation de plus en plus végétarienne réduit les risques de certains types de cancer, dont le cancer colorectal , de maladies inflammatoires, d’hypertension, de maladies cardio-vasculaires, d’obésité, de diabète, de maladies rénales, d’empoisonnement alimentaire, d’ostéoporose, de démence,..</p> <p>- Certitude documentée : les protéines végétales variées peuvent répondre adéquatement à nos besoins nutritionnels en protéines.</p> <p>( *Voir la suite des bienfaits et effets )</p> <p>- ✧ Les bienfaits et les effets de la marche -</p> <p>Accessible à tous, la marche est une activité d’intensité moyenne qui permet d’entretenir son système cardio-vasculaire et de se tonifier des pieds à la tête.</p> <p>La marche sollicite le travail de tous les muscles du corps en douceur. Pratiquée régulièrement, elle permet de purifier son organisme en stimulant le transit intestinal et d’évacuer le stress en sécrétant des endorphines, les fameuses hormones du bonheur, elle lutte efficacement contre les tensions du quotidien.</p> <p>La marche pousse l'organisme à brûler des calories et à convertir les glucides, les graisses et les protéines en énergie plutôt qu'en réserves adipeuses, les muscles sont renforcés, la silhouette est affinée.</p> <p>Elle prévient le risque de maladies cardiovasculaires et du diabète, améliore la fonction cardiaque, le cœur bat moins vite au repos et les capacités respiratoires sont améliorées.</p> <p>Elle facilite la résistance à l’effort, les risques de douleurs articulaires et les blessures sont réduites contrairement à d’autres activités. Enfin, La marche a des nombreux bénéfices sur la santé physique, mentale et le bien-être. (*voir)</p> <p>- ✧Les bienfaits et les effets du bain de forêt -</p> <p>Les études démontrent que le bain de forêt joue un rôle bénéfique sur la tension, la dépression, l’anxiété, la fatigue, la confusion; le cortisol salivaire diminue et donc le taux de glucose dans le sang baisse chez les diabétiques. Il agit sur l’humeur, donc on constate un meilleur sentiment de vivacité, une baisse de l’hostilité et de l’état dépressif, et bien d'autres...L’influence des environnements forestiers sur nos sens démontre que nos systèmes sensoriels sont influencés par les informations reçues de façon visuelle, auditive, olfactive et même tactile.</p> <p>▼- Programme -</p> <p>✧ Lors de ce workshop, nous vous proposons de découvrir la cuisine végétarienne et végétalienne à travers un atelier consacré à l'ail des ours que nous trouvons en forêt au début du printemps ; de la découvrir et d'y goutter toutes les saveurs avec un grand Chef de cuisine du monde végétarienne, végétalienne.</p> <p>* Echauffement.</p> <p>* Marche Active de 1 heure.</p> <p>* Workshop Végétarian et dégustation.</p> <p>* Marche douce et bain de forêt de 1 heure 30, le retour sera suivi d'un temps de questions- réponses.</p> <p>* Etirements.</p> <p>- Matériel :</p> <p>Le cours se donnera en plein air, donc chaque participant devra prévoir les éléments suivants :</p> <p>• Tapis de yoga ou couverture.</p> <p>• Tenue confortable et adaptée au temps.(souple de préférence.)</p> <p>• Des bonnes chaussures de marche.</p> <p>• Sac à dos le plus léger possible.</p> <p>• Prévoir de l'eau.</p> <p>▼ Réservations &amp;

La prévention a bien meilleur coût.</p> <p>- Plus de 70 % des cultures céréalières produites dans les pays en voie de développement ou sous-développés sont exportées ou données aux animaux d’élevage.</p> <p>- Pour économiser : les céréales et les légumineuses coûtent moins cher à la production, à l’achat et à la conservation. Ceci permettra d’ acheter davantage de légumes.</p> <p>- Pour une meilleure répartition des denrées dans le monde et pour combattre la faim.</p> <p>- Bienfaits sur l’environnement :</p> <p>- Pour sauvegarder les réserves d’eau douce de la planète.</p> <p>- Pour réduire la destruction des forêts et sauvegarder la biodiversité.</p> <p>- Pour diminuer les gaz à effets de serre.</p> <p>- Le méthane est responsable pour la moitié du réchauffement climatique à cause humaine.

From the smallest flower on the pavement to the largest tree, all of creation whispers to us and brings hidden messages for us to discover.</p> <p>Nature offers us … space. Space to stand still, space for reflection. It becomes easier to find your own rhythm, to get in touch with what is inside you and wants to be expressed. In this workshop, we will discover different ways of introducing nature in coaching sessions or for your own growth.</p> <p>Depending on the weather, part of the workshop will be held outside, in the lovely garden of Timesmore. Tree hugging optional.</p> <p>About Greet Selderslaghs<br/>Greet Selderslaghs Is passionate about reconnecting people to their true nature. Among her earliest childhood memories are the smell of fertile soil after the rain; her grandfather leaning on his spade, contemplating the growing crops; and life in general. Greet first misinterpreted her desire to help people –not crops- to grow, and studied interior design, wanting to create a space for people to feel good. She had an interesting journey, as a civil servant, a management assistant, a manager, a teacher, a ceremony master. That included a severe burn-out, long before the term became well known (yes, she likes to pioneer).</p> <p>Greet now enjoys being self-employed; enjoying life as a coach and workshop facilitator; and teaching Biodanza. Find out more at www.artofgoodliving.eu, and www.itworkstomove.eu.</p> <p>Practical Information<br/>When?<br/>Wednesday, 27 June 2018 from 18h45-21h00</p> <p>Where?<br/>Timesmore<br/>Boulevard St Michel 47, 1040 Brussels<br/>Public transport: Metro: Montgomery; Tram: Boileau</p> <p>How much?<br/>A contribution of €12 to cover expenses including materials, drinks, snacks, etc.</p> <p>Event web page <a href=\"http://www.imaginationclub.org/brussels/trees_in_the_city.php\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.imaginationclub.org/brussels/trees_in_the_city.php</a></p> <p>Confirm Your Participation<br/>If you wish to attend this workshop, and have not already done so, please confirm your place by sending an e-mail to [masked] or following the link above.

      "description": "<p>Hallo everyone!</p> <p>I have changed the time of meet up to 3 march, because I am not in brussels in the weeks before that and it should finally get a little warmer. I hope we can meet and browse through the market and maybe even play a game in the way I imagine it.</p> <p>We will have a budget about 5-8 euros and we will look for things that interest us within this budget. In the end we meet and show what we found and we decide who the collecting winner is. Don't worry if you won't find anything, it will be fun anyway. The meet up can happen only if there is no heavy rain.</p> <p>Last meetup was very inspiring to me thanks to Clara who joined me on a sunny day to browse through the flea market. We talked a bit about the things we like and meanwhile she admires art deco, me I am more into little useful things, which make me happy when I look at them. Each time when I go to the flea market I have a thing in my mind, something I need at home and this time it was a little dose to store pepper. And I found a perfect one (see the picture in gallery). I am happy to announce that this little thing is a winner of this week, since there were no other buys. :D</p> <p>While we were walking, Clara has pointed out many interesting things like for example old wooden stands for hats, meanwhile me I was admiring a \"silent-waiter\" (thanks Clara for this word) - double level serving plate from Italy. We couldn't afford to buy all those things, but I regret that we didn't take pictures. And that's another challenge for the next meet up, except usual challenge stated above we are also going to make pictures of real antique things which we think could be interesting for collectors and post them here and possibly announce winner as well.</p> <p>See you!</p> <p>Lucia</p> ",

You can expect a day packed with innovative ideas, lots of networking opportunities and FUN. We will have 40 speakers, 6 master classes and 6 hands-on workshops, all in the efforts of demystifying Artificial Intelligence.</p> <p>The Keynote speaker: There is a budget for getting the best A.I. expert able at bringing the true face of A.I. to light to us to speak at this year’s Summit. So if you have someone in mind that impressed you recently, please send me his/her details.</p> <p>The location: In the previous 3 editions of the Summit, we constantly had trouble fitting all our eager participants into the available space. No more. This year, we reserved a much much bigger location for you all - 2,5 time larger to be exact - with one plenary seating room of 800 seats and 6 big training rooms on 2 floors at the ULB Solbosch Campus Auditorium K.<br/>Partner Village and Job Fair: There will be 2 vast areas for networking. One for the partners to show off their innovative ideas; the other for all to hire their best candidates.</p> <p>Invite your team: Make from #disummit your annual team event and have a productive day with your team at the University of Brussels.</p> <p>Recruit the best: You can promote your outstanding jobs, participate to the Job Fair and sponsor some tickets for students.</p> <p>Network and Nerd-Out: Opportunities to network and have fun will be plenty. We will use the conversation starter app again to facilitate your connexion with the most pertinent people. After the Summit, we have a beer garden set up for you to nerd-out after work with craft beer and a barbecue. Yes.</p> <p>Spread the word: As we have more capacity this year, we are implementing a special incentive program to reward your help in promoting the Summit. You are invited to bring your community at discounted rates and to earn free tickets.</p> <p>More information on disummit.com<br/>I’m looking forward to meeting you again!

It is intended for those who meet some of the following criteria:</p> <p>· You experience conflict in your professional life on a regular basis</p> <p>· You experience conflicts in your personal life</p> <p>· You are under stress and would like to know how to cope with it</p> <p>· You would like to improve the way you related to people</p> <p>· You try to avoid conflict as much as you can</p> <p>· You fear situations that are potentially conflictual</p> <p>· You apprehend any context that is emotionally charged</p> <p>Almost no one enjoys conflict. Everyone tries to avoid it. In fact, we work hard to master conflict avoidance skills. We teach our kids in school not to get into fights, avoid disagreements, walk away, give in or give up. We socialize young girls and adult women to value the relationship above their own personal interests or needs.</p> <p>As a result we are an intimacy starved culture. We raise children who do not know how to manage their anger, or productively deal with conflict. Where do our children learn how to fight, when to fight and what is worth fighting for?</p> ",

You can expect a day packed with innovative ideas, lots of networking opportunities and FUN. We will have 40 speakers, 6 master classes and 6 hands-on workshops, all in the efforts of demystifying Artificial Intelligence.</p> <p>The Keynote speaker: There is a budget for getting the best A.I. expert able at bringing the true face of A.I. to light to us to speak at this year’s Summit. So if you have someone in mind that impressed you recently, please send me his/her details.</p> <p>The location: In the previous 3 editions of the Summit, we constantly had trouble fitting all our eager participants into the available space. No more. This year, we reserved a much much bigger location for you all - 2,5 time larger to be exact - with one plenary seating room of 800 seats and 6 big training rooms on 2 floors at the ULB Solbosch Campus Auditorium K.<br/>Partner Village and Job Fair: There will be 2 vast areas for networking. One for the partners to show off their innovative ideas; the other for all to hire their best candidates.</p> <p>Invite your team: Make from #disummit your annual team event and have a productive day with your team at the University of Brussels.</p> <p>Recruit the best: You can promote your outstanding jobs, participate to the Job Fair and sponsor some tickets for students.</p> <p>Network and Nerd-Out: Opportunities to network and have fun will be plenty. We will use the conversation starter app again to facilitate your connexion with the most pertinent people. After the Summit, we have a beer garden set up for you to nerd-out after work with craft beer and a barbecue. Yes.</p> <p>Spread the word: As we have more capacity this year, we are implementing a special incentive program to reward your help in promoting the Summit. You are invited to bring your community at discounted rates and to earn free tickets.</p> <p>More information on disummit.com</p> <p>I’m looking forward to meeting you again!

This is why we value the emergence of communities that share these values and communities that are practicing deep conversations. To do so, we would like to foster the use of tools that get this kind of conversations and the one we found most useful is the case clinic used in coaching circles, a practice from Theory U by Otto Scharmer from the MIT.</p> <p>Coaching circles:</p> <p>Peer circles that use deep listening–based coaching practices are one of the most important mechanisms for holding the space for deep conversations and learning. A coaching circle usually consists of five to seven members and applies a version of the case clinic, a simple tool that doesn’t need any training. We have found that the power of these peer group circles is simply amazing. They hold the space for individual and shared renewal. As one practitioner put it in a recent coaching call with his colleagues: “You [the whole circle] are the cradle of my rebirth.” This may sound fairy-fairy or sentimental to some, but it is in fact an accurate description of a subtle experience that all of us—and many others in their circles—have experienced.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p> ",

      "description": "<p>The philosophical café is a format for 'doing philosophy' right off the bat without the need for preparation or a capacity to throw around names of great philosophers. During the café we try to reflect on ourselves and our beliefs and convictions through posing a philosophical question and with a moderator to guide the conversation.</p> <p>We ask each other and ourselves questions and get insights from listening rather than working on our art of convincing. In doing practical philosophy, we draw on our experience both in coming up with themes and questions, and tangling with them. The atmosphere with something to drink and a shared question remains light-hearted as well.</p> <p>The below gives you all the info you need to join the café. Please read.</p> <p>THEMES INTO QUESTIONS:<br/>The first 30 minutes of the café, so from 14h, we form small subgroups. Each subgroup will get together to talk about (a) theme(s) they feel could be right for the later conversation around a question. Come to get inspired or come with a theme that you can propose to your subgroup. Perhaps you have a theme that struck you from recent experience.</p> <p>The subgroup decides on one or two themes and already turns them into questions or proposes a theme to the whole group to then come up with a final question form. Don't hesitate to work on formulating a seemingly more narrow theme and question. When thinking of work for instance, one might hear oneself/another say that they're facing a tricky moment in their life and need to achieve or feel they're not achieving.</p> <p>It's hard to see where to go when \"life\" or even \"work\" are the theme of the philosophical café. In talking with the subgroup together, you might find in this case the theme to be \"achieving\" and consequently the question could be 'when is something an achievement?'. We can use the real-world experience of the whole group to engage in conversation and it can open up different angles (work, private life or even what we are doing with the philosophical café right now).</p> <p>More on formulating questions:</p> <p>A question should be 7 words max.</p> <p>A workable (for the time that we have) question doesn't contain more than one or potentially two concepts (which we will need to investigate).</p> <p>Some examples of questions (in no particular order):</p> <p>- What is freedom?</p> <p>- What does it mean to be negative?</p> <p>- When is something humiliating?</p> <p>- When is naivety a virtue?</p> <p>- What is the Internet?</p> <p>- When is something an obsession?</p> <p>VOTING:<br/>Everybody gets to vote on each proposed question. You can choose to vote for each option you like, only the one you like best or anything in between. Any question with the most votes is selected. In case of ties for most votes, we have a second, final round of voting.</p> <p>LANGUAGE:<br/>The philosophical café will be in English. There is no need to be a native speaker - and most participants are not. A good working knowledge of English works. I moderate so we speak one at a time and insuring we understand each other's position.</p> <p>LOCATION:<br/>We are meeting at Les Meubles du Coeur. Drinks can only be paid in cash. Please be there on time so we can get settled in and get started quickly. I will be there a bit before 14h.</p> <p>Hope to see you all, including new faces, soon!</p> ",

      "description": "<p>Karl Marx was born 200 years ago this May. A few weeks ago we discussed part of William Clare Roberts' recent book \"Marx' Inferno\". We discussed the notions of force and fraud under capitalism (chapters 4 and 5 of Roberts´ book). On this occasion the proposed reading is directly from Marx' \"Capital\": part 8 of volume 1 of Capital entitled \"Primitive Accumulation\", which is only 35 pages. This event is standalone, no need to have attended any previous meetup. The text of Capital is freely available here: <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm</a></p> <p>Those who want can have the accompanying read of Roberts chapter 6 (and 7, the conclusion). To be investigated is the notion of primitive accumulation but this could be supplemented during our time together with a discussion of the state under capitalism (role in expropriation, legislation, industrialization, colonialism). We could perhaps conclude our session placing our own understanding of primitive accumulation as well as the state today with what we find with Marx directly, getting inspiration from Roberts' book or any other secondary literature/sources you might know of. All suggestions are welcome.</p> <p>Other materials:<br/>Marx is making somewhat of a comeback (as a body of thought or as a boogeyman; Marxism is dead). Here is a two part series discussing \"Marx on the internet\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5c4vrXKtiI\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5c4vrXKtiI</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUY_zEkVz88\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUY_zEkVz88</a></p> <p>In a way these videos can serve as a little follow-up or reminder or our previous discussion as we discussed Marx desire to critique other socialist thinkers who perhaps wanted a different distribution of social goods but were unwilling to \"go through capitalism and come out the other side\". I mention here Zero Books (see the above video links) and Mark Fisher's book Capitalist Realism. It's a Jameson/Zizek inspired take on capitalism being so dominant that no alternatives can even be conceived. As we discussed about Marx' desire to \"go through\" capitalism, here we see an argument that there is (no longer?) any way out the other side through the giant's ass at the bottom of Hell.</p> <p>From wikipedia: \"As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the Althusserian conception of ideology, as well as the work of Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek. Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives. He proposes that the 2008 financial crisis compounded this position; rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the response to the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business ontology' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.\"</p> <p>About \"Marx' Inferno\":<br/>Marx's Inferno reconstructs the major arguments of Karl Marx's Capital and inaugurates a completely new reading of a seminal classic. Rather than simply a critique of classical political economy, William Roberts argues that Capital was primarily a careful engagement with the motives and aims of the workers' movement. Understood in this light, Capital emerges as a profound work of political theory. Placing Marx against the background of nineteenth-century socialism, Roberts shows how Capital was ingeniously modeled on Dante's Inferno, and how Marx, playing the role of Virgil for the proletariat, introduced partisans of workers' emancipation to the secret depths of the modern -social Hell.- In this manner, Marx revised republican ideas of freedom in response to the rise of capitalism.<br/>(<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30009123-marx-s-inferno\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30009123-marx-s-inferno</a>)</p> ",

You know them- they changed the way you spoke to your friends, found information, bought clothes and books, and more...their influence (and that of their peers) on how we live now can hardly be over-estimated.</p> <p>Many benefits- but at a fearsome price. Are we more isolated now, more prone to envy fuelled mental disorders, are our elections less free? Have a handful of private enterprises unwittingly reversed the tide of progress towards peace and a liberal world order in just a few decades? Or are these old problems, simply raising their heads after a lull in the storm?</p> <p>And even if tech companies are unduly influential- do governments have the capacity (let alone the will) to do something about it? Anyone who witnessed the blunt savaging that one CEO recently received at the hands of a few legislators may well wonder if the problem lies with bad tech, or bad politicians.</p> <p>It's a topic worth debating.

La genèse de cette oeuvre littéraire a débuté dix ans plus tôt en Equateur, lors que l’auteur fut surpris un jour au coeur de la forêt amazonienne par un épouvantable orage, et se réfugiât avec ses compagnons amérindiens dans une hutte habitée par un blanc d'un certain âge. De cette rencontre sylvestre, particulièrement conviviale, est né Le vieux qui lisait des romans d'amour et dont j’espère vous donnera envier d’en discuter lors de notre prochaine rencontre.</p> ",

This very important but often overlooked feature can make or break the data refresh for your reports. Nicky van Vroenhoven will guide us through the what, how and why of query folding.<br/>Next up is Indira Bandari, speaker at SQL Saturday conferences and an impressive career of already 15 years in BI. She'll be guiding us through an innovative solution she build, combining Google Forms, SSRS and Power BI. This is a session that was also recently selected at a SQL Saturday, so really a must see!</p> <p>--- Agenda ---<br/>• 18:00 - 18:30 - Free food &amp; drinks, sponsored by Microsoft<br/>• 18:30 - 19:30 - Query folding in Power BI<br/>• 19:30 - 19:35 - Break<br/>• 19:35 - 20:40 - (remote) Google Forms meet Power BI via Reporting Services (SSRS)<br/>• 20:40 - ??:?? - Drinks, discussions and fun</p> <p>--- Session 1 ---<br/>* Query folding in Power BI *</p> <p>Power Query allows you to extract and transform data from a variety of data sources. Have you ever noticed that the importing of data is slower than you expected? In most of those cases, query folding is not happening. Query folding is very important because it offloads data transformations to the source instead of doing them in Power BI. Come learn how you can ensure you get all the performance improvements possible for your reports! As a bonus, you'll also learn when query folding is not your best friend.</p> <p>Speaker: Nicky van Vroenhoven<br/>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyvV\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/NickyvV</a>)<br/>(<a href=\"https://www.nickyvv.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.nickyvv.com</a>)<br/>Nicky van Vroenhoven is a BI professional focused at the Microsoft stack.

There is some space set-up at the venue decorated for some portrait shooting. Sorry, it's very limited and you should not be famous for your no-shows.<br/>Please contact me if you are interested in participating.<br/>It's a no money involved meetup.</p> ",
